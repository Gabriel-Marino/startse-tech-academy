# Semantic HTML

#### Semantic is the area of linguistic which study the relation between the meaning and the significant.

#### Semantic HTML consist in the use of semantic elements, more descriptive and less generic for better pages structure.

#### Semantic elements contribute further than the readability, contribute too to search engine optimization (seo), to page readers, help the developers with which type of data should go there.

#### Exist more than 100 hundred semantic elemets, some of them are:
* article
* aside
* details
* figcaption
* figure
* footer
* header
* main
* mark
* nav
* section
* summary
* times

> all semantic elements work exactly like the div element, but it's certainly more easy to read semantic elements instead of a bunch div's, and there a lot of more advantages in semantic html.

## **reiterating:** Semantic HTML consist in the use of semantic elements, more descriptive and less generic for better pages structure.
