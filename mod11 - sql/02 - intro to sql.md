A Database is an organized collection of data and structures, mostly common stroraged in eletronic form and in a computer system.

want to solve:
* redundant data
* inconsistent data
* difficult to access data
* isolated data
* multiple users
* security issues
* data integrity
* atomicity

---

Justification:
database management systems (DBMS) are the interface used to store and retrieve data from a database.

DBMS characteristics:
* redundancy control: data is stored in one place
* data share environment: ensure the access to the data among multiple users
* access control: restrict the access to the data
* interface: easily to retrieve data
* schema: mechanism to relate data between tables
* integrity control: applications and access can't corrupt the data
* backups: easily to recover data in case of software or hardware failure

Types of DBMS:
* relational: store data in tables, storage data in rows and columns, like a spreadsheet
  * column: storage a specific data type in a table
  * row: represent the data storaged in one instance of a table
  * shared data points, commonly used with SQL language
* NoSQL: store data in documents, like a JSON
* Object-oriented DB
* distributed DB
* Data Warehouse
* graph DB
* OLTP DB
* cloud DB

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. Developed by IBM in the 70's. Most common used in relational databases.
Declarative language, used to query, manipulate and update data e give access to the data.
Most common, but not the only one for DBMS.

SQL communicates between the DBMS and the DDL (Data Definition Language) and the DML (Data Manipulation Language).

Challenges in DB:
* absorption of greater data volume
* assurance of data security
* follow the demand of the users
* management and maintenance of the data and structure
* overcoming the limitations of the scalability
