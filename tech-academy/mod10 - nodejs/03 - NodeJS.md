#### NodeJS is a tool for using JavaScript outside a browser. Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009. NodeJS is what let us work with JavaScript in the back-end.

#### With Node is possible to create light and scalable applications.

#### R. Dahl chosen JavaScript because the language has an architeture which is non-blocking single thread.

#### JavaScript Architeture is based in three pillars: Call Stack, Callback Queue and Event Loop.

#### Call Stack is a pile of the calls of the functions

#### callback Queue is the pile of callbacks (functions which are sent as parameters for other functions)

#### Event Loop is resposable for continuously checking if any event was triggered and then running the callback function.

#### Node is good for handle high volume of requests. And isn't good for multicore applications.
