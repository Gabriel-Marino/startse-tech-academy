#### An objects is an abstract representation of an element of the real world which have own characteristics

#### Every object have:
* attributes: the characteristics
* methods: functions that are associated to the objects

#### Multiple objects can be created from the same class, so each time an object is created he is instantiated (referenced in a new memory location)

#### Encapsulation
##### ItÂ´s a way to hide the data in a class, to protect the acess to the data, to encapsulate it's needed to create a method to read or write the data in the attribute instead of given direct acess to the data

#### Heritage
##### A way to use attributes and methods from other classes in a new class derivated from those first ones. The class which give the heritage is named superclass and the derivated is named subclass. A superclass contain all common methods between all subclasses and a subclass have method and attributes which deppend on the context of the subclass.

#### Polymorphism
##### It's when a subclass overwrite the method from the superclass
