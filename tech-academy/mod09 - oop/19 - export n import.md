#### one way of keep organization is separating the classes in diferrent files, to do that is needed to export and import the classes

#### so using export before the word class when defining one will export the class

#### in javascript to import is just need to write at the begging of the file "import { &lt;functions or classes to be imported&gt; } from '&lt;path to the file where they're defined&gt;'"

#### in html is needed to specify "type="module"" when calling the file as script
