#### A programming paradigm derived from declarative programming

#### objects have more reusabillity than imperative programming and procedural/structured paradigm

#### In JS an object is declared through a model or template named class, Classes have standards characteristics (attributes) commons between the objects of same type; Classes have standard behaviors (methods) commons to the objects of the same type.

#### Is possible to instance (create) multiple objects from one declared class.

#### The reusabillity come from the possibility to use different methods from different classes to generate some result
