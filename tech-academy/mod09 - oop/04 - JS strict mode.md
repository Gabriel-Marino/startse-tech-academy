#### By standard in JS is not mandatory to declare a variable (is possible to create a new variable without var/let/const), this lead to errors and misconceptions

#### So it's possible to use "use strict" at the begging of the document to disable this behavior and make mandatory use var/let/const when calling a new attribute
> at the begging of the document the strict mode is applied globally, but cant be restricted to the scope of functions
