#### Like the statis attribute, a static method belong only to the class in which he is declared and can't be called by the objects instantiated by this class

#### To declared a static method just declare a method with the word "static" before the method name

#### An advantage of using static methods is the possibility of calling the method inside another classes without needing to instantiate an object
